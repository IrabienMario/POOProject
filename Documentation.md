<p>The general objective of the project is to carry out the implementation of an agile administrative program to replace an outdated administrative system, which is adaptable to the company's needs. The program will utilize SQL to efficiently manage the company's data, featuring an HTML interface that can utilize Java commands for better database management. The project aims to meet an administrative need of the DN company, which is seeking an agile way to enhance its production processes.
