## Introduction

To undertake an Object-Oriented Programming Project, several students from the Universidad Autónoma de Yucatán have embarked on a real-world endeavor within a company.

This particular project involves the transformation of an outdated accounting system into a modern one known as 'Comercial Pro.' This adaptable software leverages SQL to efficiently manage the company's data. For this specific company, which we will refer to as DN, there arose a need for an extension to oversee the various orders received daily.

DN specializes in selling a wide range of souvenirs to diverse companies. To facilitate these sales, they must first manufacture the products within their various laboratories, including the carpentry laboratory, sewing laboratory, serigraphy laboratory, and so forth.

This feature was seamlessly integrated into the new software. However, it necessitated the installation of new computers in all the laboratories planning to utilize this functionality, alongside the acquisition of additional software licenses.

To address this challenge in a cost-effective manner, we proposed the implementation of a new project. This project revolves around the creation of a web-based platform serving as an interface for interaction between the laboratories and the administrative department. Consequently, laboratories can access the company's central database via the web, obviating the need for new computer installations.
