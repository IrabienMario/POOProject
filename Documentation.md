# Development Plan.
<h1>Objectives.</h1>
Our main objective is to create a website that can be accessed by any company or individual to record orders and production.

<h1>Resources.</h1>
To achieve our goal, we need the necessary development team, in this case, a team of software engineering undergraduate students. Additionally, we need tools for programming, defining objectives, goals, and a channel for team communication.

<h1>Schedule.</h1>
Project deliveries will be made for review at the end of each month, with the first delivery scheduled for Friday, September 22nd of the current year.

<h1>Responsibilities.</h1>
Responsibilities have been assigned for the project as follows:
Mario Irabien: Project Introduction
Victor Rosado: Non-Functional Requirements
Emiliano Arceo: Use Cases and Functional Requirements
Carlos Ek: Limitations
Xavier Dzib: Development Plan
These responsibilities are for the first project delivery and may change as the project progresses.

<h1>Tracking.</h1>
To ensure clear tracking of project development, the project has been divided into three stages: Key Definitions, Functionality, and Final Design. These stages are followed by monthly sub-deliveries.

<h1>Comunication.</h1>
To keep the team well-informed and aligned with the project's development, we have adopted the Scrum development methodology, which includes weekly and daily team reviews, project definitions, discussions, etc. We will also use the GitHub platform to manage the project documentation.
