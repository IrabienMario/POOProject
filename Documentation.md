## Introduction.

To undertake an Object-Oriented Programming Project, several students from the Universidad Aut√≥noma de Yucat√°n have embarked on a real-world endeavor within a company.
    
This particular project involves the transformation of an outdated accounting system into a modern one known as 'Comercial Pro.' This adaptable software leverages SQL to efficiently manage the company's data. For this specific company, which we will refer to as DN, there arose a need for an extension to oversee the various orders received daily.

DN specializes in selling a wide range of souvenirs to diverse companies. To facilitate these sales, they must first manufacture the products within their various laboratories, including the carpentry laboratory, sewing laboratory, serigraphy laboratory, and so forth. Finally, the project has been successfully concluded, resulting in a program that more effectively carries out the company's tasks and its database is also hosted on a server in the cloud. In this way we present the details in the following documentation:

This feature was seamlessly integrated into the new software. However, it necessitated the installation of new computers in all the laboratories planning to utilize this functionality, alongside the acquisition of additional software licenses.

To address this challenge in a cost-effective manner, we proposed the implementation of a new project. This project revolves around the creation of a web-based platform serving as an interface for interaction between the laboratories and the administrative department. Consequently, laboratories can access the company's central database via the web, obviating the need for new computer installations.

## Overall Objective and Specific Objectives.
Throughout the development of the project, no objectives have been modified or added, so we emphasize those proposed from the very start.
<p>The general objective of the project was to implement an agile administrative program to replace an already obsolete administrative system.
It turned out to be adaptable to the needs of the company. Using SQL database software to efficiently manage company data, presenting an HTML interface that can use Java commands for better database management. The project finally satisfies an administrative need of the DN company, which required an agile way to enhance its production processes.</p>

<p>The program finally uses a web-based platform that allows the use of the tools provided by the previous system but now with a more user-friendly interface, eliminating the need to purchase new equipment and licenses for the current software.
As an objective achieved, laboratories can now send notifications to the administrative department when the products have been finished and are ready for delivery.</p>

<p>The specific objectives of the project are as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Create an HTML-formatted user interface:</strong> Develop an intuitive user interface using HTML that allows users to interact with the program effortlessly, minimizing the need for extensive training.</li>

  <li><strong>Ensure a well-organized class structure with sustainable development functions:</strong> Implement proper class and function organization within the software to enhance code quality and maintainability, ensuring the long-term sustainability of the project.</li>

  <li><strong>Implement database updates through efficient inserts and updates:</strong> Keep the database current by seamlessly incorporating data updates and inserts, ensuring the accurate representation of company information for informed decision-making.</li>

  <li><strong>Streamlining of Processes:</strong> The program will streamline the production system of DN company, enabling a more efficient and expedited execution of its processes.</li>

  <li><strong>Adaptability:</strong> The program will adapt to the production systems currently in place at DN company, ensuring a faster implementation process by seamlessly integrating with their existing infrastructure.</li>
</ol>

## Relevance.

The importance of the project revolves around the problem of efficiency, which is a real need in a real company. The real DN company sought to enhance both its administrative and productive processes. To achieve this, the company has been exploring ways to optimize its operations by implementing accounting software solutions, aimed at alleviating the current workload challenges facing the company. That is why, in addition to being a school-related project, all the processes, coding and documentation carried out in this project were already implemented in the real world.

Additionally, the level of this project helps us in the future to demonstrate to companies how the experience we have acquired (mostly related to Java coding, HTML, SQL and the development process) is used in this implementation.

## Non-functional requirements.

As part of non-functional requirements, we were able to meet the ones proposed at the beginning of the project.

### Security

Security is defined as the way in which the system is protected with the data it contains to prevent loss or data breaches from unauthorized sources.
| Requeriment | Name | Description |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| **RNF 1** | Authentication | All users are authenticated to log in and use the system. There is a username and password. |
| **RNF 2**  | Multiple sessions  | The system does not restrict multiple sessions opened in the browser or workstation with the same user.   |
| **RNF 3** | Maintain login | The system maintains the user's login in case of web server failures. |

### Availability

The time in which the system is functional and working.
| Requeriment | Name | Description |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| **RNF 4** | High availability | The system is available when the user likes to use it. This quality scenario is met by the infrastructure and deployment proposal presented.  |

| **RNF 7** |There is a scheme to manage specific configuration properties of the resources used by the application. For example, the name of the database. |

## Project priorities.

For a successful program implementation, it is required to have a development schedule, through which the most crucial functions required by the software are evaluated. To achieve this, an administrative meeting was conducted involving developers, company administrators, and the employees who will be using the software upon its development. 

During the meeting, agreements were reached, and it was determined that the most pressing need was communication between the laboratories and the administration. As a result, a high priority will be given to the communication between the laboratory and the database, as well as the communication from the database to the laboratory.

## Class Diagrams

For the organization and development of this project, we will divide the necessary functionalities into different classes that aid in the implementation and maintenance of the software. To accomplish this, we will utilize the Java programming language, allowing us to implement the requirements more efficiently.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/DigramadeClases (2).png">
</p>

This implementation of classes and interfaces will enable us to achieve our objectives and requirements with respect to the software. It is divided in such a way that it allows for the proper functioning of the software, making it easier to maintain, more user-friendly for the programmer, and straightforward to modify.

## Usage of classes in the requirements

For a better visualization of requirement fulfillment, the following table displays the relationship between the class and the requirement it satisfies.
