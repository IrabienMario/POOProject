# Changes

The major changes from the initial delivery involve the design implementation of the program. In the first delivery, we made progress in shaping the structure of our code. When compared to the current delivery, there is a significant improvement in the organization of the code, as well as the visual aspect within the project. We have successfully implemented the program's interface, featuring a login interface and another for the usage and management of tables.

These changes represent a substantial enhancement in both the structural and visual aspects of the codebase. The initial steps taken in the first delivery laid the groundwork, and in the current version, we have refined the code organization for better readability and maintainability. Additionally, the implementation of the program's interface, especially the login interface and table usage interface, signifies a crucial step towards providing a user-friendly and functional experience for our end-users.

The login interface ensures a secure and controlled access point, enhancing the overall security of the program. On the other hand, the table usage interface is pivotal for users to interact with and manage data efficiently. This includes features such as viewing, editing, and updating data within the tables, contributing to a seamless user experience.

The visual improvements go beyond mere aesthetics; they contribute to a more intuitive and user-friendly interaction. The thoughtful design of the program's interface aims to facilitate users in navigating through the functionalities effortlessly.

Overall, these changes in the current delivery reflect a commitment to refining both the internal structure and the user-facing components of the program, ensuring a more polished and effective software product.
