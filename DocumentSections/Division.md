## Contribution Metrics and Adjustments

The team has established a contribution metric, calculated as a percentage based on the division of tasks and responsibilities for each delivery, ensuring a fair distribution of work. This metric, reflecting a 100% total contribution, is objectively measured and documented to facilitate tracking and verification of individual contributions. 

The current distribution for the latest delivery is as follows:
- **Mario Irabien:** 100%
- **Victor Hugo:** 100%
- **Carlos Ek:** 70%
- **Emiliano Arceo:** 70%
- **Xavier Dzip:** 60%

This transparent breakdown allows for a clear assessment of individual contributions, fostering a collaborative environment. Adjustments have been made to ensure equitable workloads and address any disparities in the team's contributions. The team is committed to refining these metrics continuously for optimal collaboration and project success.
