# Production Order Manager for DN - POO Project
## Introduction

To undertake an Object-Oriented Programming Project, several students from the Universidad Autónoma de Yucatán have embarked on a real-world endeavor within a company.

This particular project involves the transformation of an outdated accounting system into a modern one known as 'Comercial Pro.' This adaptable software leverages SQL to efficiently manage the company's data. For this specific company, which we will refer to as DN, there arose a need for an extension to oversee the various orders received daily.

DN specializes in selling a wide range of souvenirs to diverse companies. To facilitate these sales, they must first manufacture the products within their various laboratories, including the carpentry laboratory, sewing laboratory, serigraphy laboratory, and so forth.

The development of this extension was successfully integrated into the new software. However, its implementation was primarily focused on the administrative department, responsible for ensuring the completion of all orders. A crucial feature was required to enable the laboratories to notify the administrative team once the products were ready for delivery.

This feature was seamlessly integrated into the new software. However, it necessitated the installation of new computers in all the laboratories planning to utilize this functionality, alongside the acquisition of additional software licenses.

To address this challenge in a cost-effective manner, we proposed the implementation of a new project. This project revolves around the creation of a web-based platform serving as an interface for interaction between the laboratories and the administrative department. Consequently, laboratories can access the company's central database via the web, obviating the need for new computer installations.

The web platform will boast an interactive interface and will communicate with the database through a combination of Java logic and SQL queries, utilizing updates and inserts to manage production control seamlessly.

## Project Objetive

The project recently initiated addresses a critical need within the DN company. To integrate it into the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Project, we will execute the development in two phases:

### Functionality:
Given the academic nature of this project, our initial focus is on functionality. This phase revolves around the interaction of the program's interface with the core database. We will employ logical constructs and object-oriented principles to govern system functions.

### Web Development:
In the more advanced stage of the project, we will proceed with the second component of the implementation, which entails web development.
