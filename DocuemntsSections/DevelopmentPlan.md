# Development Plan.
## Objectives.
Our main objective is to create a website that can be accessed by any company or individual to record orders and production.

## Resources.
To achieve our goal, we need the necessary development team, in this case, a team of software engineering undergraduate students. Additionally, we need tools for programming, defining objectives, goals, and a channel for team communication.For the development, we will make use of the technologies provided by GitHub, such as GitHub Desktop, GitKraken, etc. The programming languages we will use are Java for the logic, HTML for the interfaces, and SQL for database management.

## Schedule.
Project deliveries will be made for review at the end of each month, with the first delivery scheduled for Friday, September 22nd of the current year. For task management, we will follow the Scrum methodology, which includes a meeting every Wednesday at 9 am. During this meeting, we will discuss task assignments and provide a Q&A session to maintain effective work control. Throughout the week, each team member will work on their tasks within their respective branches and submit pull requests once they are completed. The team leader will review the changes made and provide feedback on the pull requests.

## Weightage
For task division, the project will be broken down into a series of tasks, each of which can be viewed as discussions within Git. Each task will have a score and assigned points. At the end of the project, the points earned by each participant for successfully completing their assigned tasks will be totaled for a fair points distribution.

## Responsibilities.
Responsibilities have been assigned for the project as follows:

  Mario Irabien: Team Leader.
  Victor Rosado: Front-End Developer.
  Emiliano Arceo: Back-End Developer.
  Carlos Ek: Back-End Developer.
  Xavier Dzib: Front-End Developer.
  
These responsibilities may change as the project progresses.

## Tracking.
To ensure clear tracking of project development, the project has been divided into three stages: Documentation, Functionality, and Final Design. These stages are followed by daily tasks that have values to quantify the progress and work division.

## Comunication.
To keep the team well-informed and aligned with the project's development, we have adopted the Scrum development methodology, which includes weekly and daily team reviews, project definitions, discussions, etc. We will also use the GitHub platform to manage the project documentation.

All of this can be reflected in the project's repository.
