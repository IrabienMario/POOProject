## Project Scopes.

In this project, the objectives we aim to achieve are the development of a functional web software that will enable the DN company to enhance its production processes for the benefit of the organization. Our ultimate goal is the sale and implementation of this software within the real-world company.

## Limitations.

<p>There are several limitations to consider in the context of this project:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Academic Nature of the Project:</strong> This project is primarily academic in nature. As a result, the initial focus is on functionality. The emphasis is on learning and gaining practical experience, which may not reach the same level of complexity or scale as a commercial project. Additionally, certain aspects such as security or scalability may not be addressed as extensively during this academic phase.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <p><strong>Interaction between Interface and Central Database:</strong> The project's initial phase centers around the interaction between the program's interface and the central database. While this is essential for functionality, it may mean that other critical aspects of a real-world project, such as data security may not be fully explored during this phase.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Creation of a Database Copy:</strong> To facilitate software development for the academic project, a copy of the database is being created on a separate computer from the main server. While this practice is common in academic and development settings, it may not be feasible in a production environment due to security and data synchronization considerations.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

## Relevance.

The significance of this project is that the problem we are solving is a real necessity in a real company. The real company DN is seeking to enhance both its administrative and production processes. To achieve this, the company has been exploring ways to streamline its operations through the implementation of accounting software solutions, aimed at alleviating the current workload challenges the company faces. That's why, besides being a school-related project, all the processes, coding, and documentation done in this project are a depiction of what would happen in a real implementation.

Also, the level of this project would help us in the future to demostrate to the companys how the experencied we have gaind (most related to coding in Java, HTML, SQL, and the process of the development) is used in this deployment. Being able to reach to a level that we could sell this possibility of resolution to the DN company.

## Project priorities.

For a successful program implementation, it is required to have a development schedule, through which the most crucial functions required by the software are evaluated. To achieve this, an administrative meeting was conducted involving developers, company administrators, and the employees who will be using the software upon its development. 

During the meeting, agreements were reached, and it was determined that the most pressing need was communication between the laboratories and the administration. As a result, a high priority will be given to the communication between the laboratory and the database, as well as the communication from the database to the laboratory.
