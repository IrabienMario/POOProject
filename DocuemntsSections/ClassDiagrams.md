## Class Diagrams

For the organization and development of this project, we will divide the necessary functionalities into different classes that aid in the implementation and maintenance of the software. To accomplish this, we will utilize the Java programming language, allowing us to implement the requirements more efficiently.

This implementation of classes and interfaces will enable us to achieve our objectives and requirements with respect to the software. It is divided in such a way that it allows for the proper functioning of the software, making it easier to maintain, more user-friendly for the programmer, and straightforward to modify.

## Usage of classes in the requirements

For a better visualization of requirement fulfillment, the following table displays the relationship between the class and the requirement it satisfies.

| Class                                              | Functional requirement it satisfies  |
|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|

| <p align="center"> <img src="assets/Class2.png"></p> | RF1, RF2, RF9, RNF1                 |
| <p align="center"> <img src="assets/Class3.png"></p> | RNF7                                |
| <p align="center"> <img src="assets/Class4.png"></p> | RF5, RF7, RF8                       |
